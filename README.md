For the next 10 days, learn the GO Programming language.

## Getting Started

[Go Cheat Sheet](./CheatSheet.md)

Cheat Sheets are handy. Lets have a glance how the Go langulage is looks like, basic building blocks and langulage fundamentals.

### Prerequisites

Fresh Mind! It will help you to learn a new langualge in 10 days which will be your 1st basecamp to learn programming Smart Contract in Blockchain.

However, knowing other programing langualge will help you learn faster.


### Day 1: Installing and IDE setup

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

### Day 2: Go Language Fundamentals (Packages, variables, and functions)
Learn the basic components of any Go program.

### Day 3: Go Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer
Learn how to control the flow of your code with conditionals, loops, switches and defers.

### Day 4: Go More types: structs, slices, and maps.
Learn how to define types based on existing ones: this lesson covers structs, arrays, slices, and maps.

### Day 5: Go Methods and interfaces
This lesson covers methods and interfaces, the constructs that define objects and their behavio

### Day 6: Go Concurrency
Go provides concurrency features as part of the core language.
This module goes over goroutines and channels, and how they are used to implement different concurrency patterns.

### Day 7: Go TBD
### Day 8: Go TBD
### Day 9: Go TBD
### Day 10: GoTBD

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
